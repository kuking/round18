# Round18

WIP, hopefully this ends up being a nice example of a full-fledged micro-services stack made up with: Kafka, Spring Boot components, ci-auto-deployments
It is all in one project as it is meant to be simple proof-of-concept.
Other shinny technologies that might get included: Spark, Akka(TBD)

## Components

### Console

- Spring Boot, Scala, Web gui
- it can insert random data into Kafka on user/REST API request.

### Stream Averager and FFT

A micro-service listening to the random-data generated by the console and re-writing the stream into other two topics, an rolling average and a FFT.

### Stream listener

Python script drawing the values in realtime (for the LOLz)

### Other containers

- Kafka server
- Some sort of log aggregator (TBD)
- Jenkins deployer (TBD)
- Sonar (TBD)
